#### Usages

Below is an example of sending SIGTERM signals to a process with process ID 777, and to all child processes.  

‚ö†Ô∏è _Signals are ignored on Windows platforms._

```sh
kill-tree 777
```

If you want to send another signal, you can enter that signal as the second parameter.  
Below is an example of sending a SIGKILL signal to a process with process ID 777 and to all child processes.
